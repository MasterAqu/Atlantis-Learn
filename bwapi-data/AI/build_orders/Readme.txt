### DID YOU KNOW THAT... ###

### 1 ###
You can define build orders in file that have structure like:
[you_race_letter]v[enemy_race_letter].csv
So let's say you're Protoss and play against Terran. You create file PvT.csv
It's best to just copy Atlantis_PvT and rename it to PvT so you don't have
to type everything yourself.

### 2 ###
If you define file called PvT.csv it will override Atlantis_PvT.csv build orders.
However if there's no PvT file found, Atlantis will use Atlantis_PvT instead when 
it's supposed to play PvT.

Although the files are csv, it's best to edit them in text editor like Notepad++.
