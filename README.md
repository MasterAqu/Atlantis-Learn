# Atlantis
...is a framework to write your very own Starcraft Broodwar bot in Java and it aims to achieve one thing:
*Make it much, much easier to create new bot starting from zero*.

It uses JNIBWAPI as a base, but wraps everything heavily, so you don't need to write yourself countless lines of tedious code that every bot unfortunately needs to have to even do the most basic stuff.

# How to use
Atlantis is still in the early development. The latest stable version is in the `master` branch. In `develop` you will find latest changes, but it doesn't necessarily work.

# AI tournaments
Take a look at this site: http://sscaitournament.com/

It's tournament for Starcraft bots that plays matches online 364/24/7. Pretty cool, eh?
You will find there all info about participation and submission of your bot.
